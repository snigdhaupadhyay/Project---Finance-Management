# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR 1: Programming Language
**Decision**: Python was chosen for the implementation due to its readability and ease of use.

## ADR 3: Structure
**Decision**: The project follows a modular structure, separating logic into distinct files.
                Object oriented design and SOLID principles  are followed.
                Used Plateau and ROver classes defining the funtionalities of rover and the plateaue
                Created a seprate class for rendering and simulating the rover
                Followed TDD, and test classes are seprate
                
## ADR 4: Testing Framework
**Decision**: Unittest was chosen for its simplicity and powerful features.
